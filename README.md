# freightCalc - v. 2.0

![code Output](https://github.com/danbsolo/images/blob/main/freightCalcOUTPUT%20v2.JPG)

> Determines the amount of wagons needed based on the size of each wagon and the volume of the cargo being delivered.

Comparing costs between only two objects isn't particularly challenging, so the program will now compare volume instead. Changed the names to be more descriptive as well.
