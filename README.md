Nothing special; I'm just proud of the math more than anything. This code's primary purpose was to teach myself about encapsulation more thoroughly; hence, a couple odd design choices and a lack of comments.

#### What I've learned while writing this code:
- the effectiveness of getters and setters in java (and perhaps even in more languages?)
- how height calculations operate :)
- that *do while loops* CAN have a purpose! Specifically, when it comes to "input takers," such as java's Scanner class or python's input() function
